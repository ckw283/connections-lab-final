                        lot of us it's a tie to our family and our culture. some of us may have helped our grandparents
                        bake snickerdoodles and apple pies in the kitchen, following recipes written on fading yellow
                        index cards. others of us maybe didn't learn these generational and culture recipes as children
                        and are asking our parents now how to make that curry, only to receive a somewhat frustrating
                        answer of "no measurements, just add stuff until it's good". here is a place where we can
                        document those snippets of childhood and share it with others so that those recipes (and stories
                        that go with them) may live on!</h3>
